	/// A nonrecursive left reduce.
	///
	/// Instead of calling itself recursively as a typical left-reduce might do, the implementation calls out via the `recur` parameter instead. This allows the operator to be used for both enumeration (via a fixpoint) and iteration.
	///
	/// This is written in partially applied style to simplify the construction of enumerators.
	///
	/// The combine function returns Either in order to enable early termination; returning Either.Left(x) indicates that reduction should conclude immediately with x, whereas Either.Right(y) indicates that reduction should continue with y.
